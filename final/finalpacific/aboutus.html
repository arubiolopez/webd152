              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                Pacific Trails Resort was founded by a group of nature
                enthusiasts, who wanted others to experience and view nature in
                the same lens as them. Their love for nature led them to create
                this immersive resort where people not only get the chance to be
                in nature and relax but through immersion are also able to value
                it.
              </p>
              <h3>Meet the Team</h3>
              <h4>Aurora:Founder</h4>
              <p>
                Aurora is the founder of the resort. Prior to founding the
                Pacific Trails Resort she was a marine biologist who conducted
                research in the Monterey Bay. Through her experience there she
                gained great leadership skills, but also the drive to wanting to
                share her knowledge and passion for nature with others. She now
                enjoys managing this resort where everyone gets to enjoy it in
                their own way (hiking, kayaking, etc.).
              </p>
              <h4>Ryle:Co-founder</h4>
              <p>
                Ryle is the co-founder of the resort. Prior to founding the
                Pacific Trails Resort he was a environmental science teacher who
                focused on bringing awareness to issues like global warming.
                This gave him the drive to want to bring more awareness to the
                issue on a larger scale. With the resort not only do people
                enjoy a comfortable stay but through activities they learn to
                value the planet, creating awareness in a fun, relaxing, and
                unique way.
